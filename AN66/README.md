# Building SF2000 1.6 Multicore on AN66
The bisrv in this folder is stock sf2000 1.6 with patched the buttons and screen. The buttons are the same as DY19 and the screen is the same as GB300.  
This uses the same screen as the gb300 so you must apply [this patch](https://github.com/tzubertowski/gb300_multicore/commit/0d8b553).
